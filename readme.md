# **Weather App**

This application is based on Node/Express with an EJS front end. The point of this application was a very simple implementation and quick understanding on how Express makes API calls and how to control data requests/responses with a basic front end.

EJS was used as our front end framework since I needed something simple to set up and allow for me to focus more on the functionality of the backend and the main purpose was to explore Express.

If you run the application, you will need your own API key from openweathermap.com and place it in the './config/keys.js' file. It will basically take an input from the user and make a request for the current temperature and forecast for the day.
